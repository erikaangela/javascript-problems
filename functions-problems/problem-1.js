// Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and find the longest word within the string.

/* Steps
1. Define a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter.
2. Declare and initialize a variable, testString.
3. Use split() to create a new array of individual words of the accepted string, split between spaces.
4. Loop through the new array, comparing each word's length to each other.
5. Return the value of the index with the greatest length.
*/

let testString = 'This is the given test string'

function findLongestWord(str) {
  str.split(" ");
}

console.log(findLongestWord(testString));
